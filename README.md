#### Setup

For setup instructions, please refer to the documents for the backend and the frontend respectively.

Data in /data/kaggle folder can be obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks). The files are small enough in principle right now to store on GH but might slow down versioning and might [not be good practice](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files)? 

## Notes

Please clear jupyter notebooks before committing and pushing
