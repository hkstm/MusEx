[21-02-2020 23:02] I improved the divisions, they did not really work for the other divs. Now everything should be fine! I  found a simple template for a wordcloud, I will continue working on this project tuesday. If all goes well, wordclouds are live by tuesday evening. 

[20-02-2020  18:02]  The front  page now no longer shows the react logo but an  empty field with a title and one box for the main plot. There are also different classes for the other visualizations. The  changes  where made in app.css and app.jsx
