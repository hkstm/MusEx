# VU.InfoVis2021

## Setup
Data in /data/kaggle folder can be obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks)

I installed the requirements for Kaggle.ipynb (and other related files in the future) using:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
But this might differ for you and could be something like
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Usage Notes

Please clear jupyter notebooks before committing and pushing
